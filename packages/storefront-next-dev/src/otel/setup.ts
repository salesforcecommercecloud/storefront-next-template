/**
 * OpenTelemetry tracer provider initialization.
 *
 * ## Exporter design: why ConsoleSpanExporter?
 *
 * This storefront runs in two environments:
 *   - Local development on a developer's machine (Vite dev server)
 *   - Salesforce Managed Runtime (MRT), a serverless environment backed by AWS Lambda
 *
 * Standard OpenTelemetry exporters (OTLP, Jaeger, Zipkin) are designed for
 * long-running processes: they maintain background agents, batch spans in memory,
 * and flush asynchronously. That model does not work in a serverless environment.
 * Lambda invocations must complete quickly — a background agent or async flush
 * after the response is sent would hold the Lambda open unnecessarily, increasing
 * cost and cold-start latency.
 *
 * Instead, we write spans synchronously to stdout via MrtConsoleSpanExporter — a
 * subclass of ConsoleSpanExporter that outputs structured JSON matching the format
 * MRT's log infrastructure expects. MRT collects stdout from every invocation and
 * forwards the log stream to downstream analytics systems. Telemetry reaches those
 * systems without any in-process agent or network connection from the Lambda
 * function itself.
 *
 * SimpleSpanProcessor is used (instead of BatchSpanProcessor) for the same reason:
 * immediate, synchronous export with no in-memory queue that could be lost if the
 * process exits.
 *
 * Uses NodeTracerProvider directly (instead of NodeSDK) to avoid async resource
 * detection. NodeSDK's autoDetectResources creates a Resource with
 * asyncAttributesPending=true, which causes SimpleSpanProcessor.onEnd() to
 * defer export via waitForAsyncAttributes(). In the Vite SSR module runner
 * context, that deferred microtask never executes. A synchronous Resource
 * ensures the immediate export path is always taken.
 *
 * ## Distributed tracing: W3C Trace Context propagation
 *
 * The storefront runs below Managed Runtime (MRT) in the call tree. MRT is
 * trace-aware: it makes the sampling decision and stamps an inbound W3C
 * `traceparent` header on the request the storefront receives. To appear on the
 * same end-to-end trace as the surrounding services, the storefront behaves as a
 * standard downstream participant:
 *   - It continues the inbound trace (see the Express middleware, which parses the
 *     inbound `traceparent` into the parent context).
 *   - It forwards `traceparent` on outbound fetches (the UndiciInstrumentation
 *     `requestHook` below injects it via a privately-held W3C propagator — see the
 *     `outboundPropagator` doc comment for why the global registry is bypassed).
 *   - It honors MRT's sampling decision via a ParentBasedSampler — it never forces
 *     a sampled trace and implements no sampling policy of its own. MRT owns the
 *     rate via MRT_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED / MRT_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE.
 *
 * @env SFNEXT_OTEL_ENABLED — set to `"true"` to enable (e.g. `SFNEXT_OTEL_ENABLED=true pnpm dev`)

/**
 * A privately-held W3C Trace Context propagator, used to inject `traceparent` onto
 * outbound fetches WITHOUT going through OpenTelemetry's global propagator registry.
 *
 * ## Why not the global propagator?
 *
 * `UndiciInstrumentation` injects outbound headers by calling the *global* registered
 * propagator (`propagation.inject()`). Registering one with `setGlobalPropagator()`
 * works locally, but is a silent no-op on Managed Runtime (MRT):
 *
 *   - The MRT Lambda wrapper bundles its own copy of `@opentelemetry/api` (declared
 *     `^1.9.1`, with core/sdk at 2.x) and boots first, creating the version-keyed
 *     global registry object (`globalThis[Symbol.for('opentelemetry.js.api.1')]`,
 *     stamped `version: "1.9.1"`).
 *   - Our SDK bundle ships a *different* copy of `@opentelemetry/api` (`1.9.0`). When
 *     our code calls `setGlobalPropagator()`, OTel's `registerGlobal()` compares the
 *     registry's recorded version against ours with an EXACT string match — `"1.9.1"
 *     !== "1.9.0"` — refuses the registration, and reports the error only to OTel's
 *     internal diag channel (which we do not wire up). The propagation slot stays
 *     empty, so undici's `propagation.inject()` injects nothing and no `traceparent`
 *     reaches SCAPI. Proven on soak: `propagation.fields() === []`, 0/198 outbound
 *     requests carried a header.
 *
 * This is the same multi-instance split that makes inbound `propagation.extract()`
 * fail (see `express/middleware.ts`, which bypasses it with `parseTraceParent` +
 * `trace.setSpanContext`). MRT's own data-plane tracer solves it the same way: it
 * holds a private `new W3CTraceContextPropagator()` and calls `inject()`/`extract()`
 * on it directly, never touching the global registry.
 *
 * Holding our own instance and injecting it ourselves (in the undici `requestHook`)
 * makes outbound propagation deterministic and independent of MRT's bundle, its OTel
 * version, and its boot order. We deliberately do NOT call `setGlobalPropagator()` —
 * leaving the global propagator as the default no-op guarantees undici's own
 * `propagation.inject()` (which runs right after our hook) adds nothing, so the
 * `traceparent` is written exactly once in every environment.

/**
 * Initializes OpenTelemetry and returns a Tracer from the provider directly.
 *
 * Returns the tracer via `provider.getTracer()` instead of the global
 * `trace.getTracer()` API. In the Vite SSR module runner, the built
 * dist/entry/server.js and the externalized @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node
 * resolve @opentelemetry/api to different module instances (different paths
 * through pnpm's strict node_modules). Each instance has its own
 * ProxyTracerProvider singleton, so `provider.register()` sets the delegate
 * on sdk-trace-node's API instance while our code's `trace.getTracer()`
 * reads from a separate API instance with no delegate — returning a tracer
 * backed by a bare BasicTracerProvider with NoopSpanProcessor.
 *
 * Getting the tracer directly from the provider bypasses the global registry
 * entirely, guaranteeing the tracer uses our configured span processors.
