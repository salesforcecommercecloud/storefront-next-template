 * (ID and path) are available on the client before any other scripts execute.
 *
 * @private This is an internal SDK component — do not import directly.
 * It is automatically applied via the `patchReactRouter` Vite plugin at build time.
 * Customers should use `Scripts` from `react-router` as normal; the plugin transparently
 * substitutes this enhanced version in production builds.
 *
 * @param props - Props passed through to the underlying React Router Scripts component
 * @returns A fragment containing internal bundle scripts and React Router scripts
