import type { Plugin } from 'vite';

/**
 * Vite plugin contributing the baseline Vite config required by the
 * Storefront Next framework. These settings are uniform across every
 * customer project and are not intended to be customized.
 *
 * Additional framework-level Vite defaults should be added here rather
 * than in the template's vite.config.ts or in a new single-purpose plugin.
 *
 * Current defaults:
 * - `resolve.dedupe`: prevents duplicate React / React Router copies on the
 *   client. Duplicate React instances cause hooks to throw "Invalid hook call".
 * - `optimizeDeps.include`: forces Vite's dep optimizer to pre-bundle
 *   `react-router` and its `/internal/react-server-client` entry so the
 *   React Router dev plugin resolves a single shared instance on the client.
 *   It also pre-bundles the React-importing entry points of the runtime SDK
 *   (`/config`, `/security/react`, `/site-context`, `/design/react/core`,
 *   `/routing/app-wrapper`, `/i18n/client`). Without this, Vite optimizes the
 *   app's own React first, then *discovers* these SDK subpaths the first time a
 *   component imports them at request time, triggers a dep re-optimization, and
 *   forces a full-page reload. During that window the SDK's React hooks
 *   (`useConfig` → `useContext`) momentarily resolve against a second, freshly
 *   optimized React instance — surfacing as "Invalid hook call" / "Cannot read
 *   properties of null (reading 'useContext')" until the reload settles.
 *   Including them up front means a single first-pass optimization with one
 *   shared React, so no mid-session re-optimize and no transient duplicate.
 * - `ssr.noExternal`: forces the SDK through Vite's SSR transform pipeline
 *   in dev. The SDK exports module-level singletons (router contexts, etc.)
 *   whose object identity is load-bearing — they're used as `Map` keys, so
 *   reads and writes must reference the same object. In dev SSR, Vite can
 *   externalize a package for some import sites (loaded by Node's native
 *   ESM resolver) while transforming it for others (loaded by Vite's SSR
 *   transform pipeline), producing two distinct module records for the
 *   same file on disk. When that happens, the singletons are constructed
 *   twice and the keys no longer match — context lookups silently return
 *   the default value. `noExternal` collapses both paths into Vite's
 *   transform cache so there is exactly one module record. Production
 *   builds inline the SDK into the SSR bundle and are unaffected. We
 *   don't blanket-`noExternal` every dependency because most third-party
 *   packages are identity-agnostic (two copies work fine) and externalizing
 *   keeps dev startup fast — only packages exporting identity-sensitive
 *   singletons need this treatment.
 *
 * @returns {Plugin} A Vite plugin contributing the framework's base config.
