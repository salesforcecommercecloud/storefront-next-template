 * templates fill this (typically with `Omit<AppConfig, 'serverExtension'>`),
 * those reads return the narrowed shape and `.serverExtension` becomes a
 * TypeScript error in client code. The server `getConfig(context)` overload is
 * unaffected. Empty by default — un-augmented customers fall back to
 * `AppConfigShape`, so the upgrade is zero-breakage. See README-CONFIG.md.
 *
 * Defined as a separate slot rather than `Omit<AppConfigShape, KeySet>` because
 * the latter doesn't compose with `AppConfigShape`'s `[key: string]: unknown`
 * index signature: `Omit` over an index-signatured interface produces a mapped
 * type that subsumes the augmented members.
 *
 * Caveat for templates: keep your `AppConfig` itself **index-signature-free at
 * the top level**. If your template's `AppConfig` carries a `[key: string]:
 * unknown`, then `Omit<AppConfig, 'serverExtension'>` keeps that signature,
 * which makes `serverExtension` resolve to `unknown` at the call site
 * (accessible, not removed) and silently defeats the narrow. The retail
 * template's `AppConfig` (`src/types/config.ts`) demonstrates the
 * index-signature-free shape.
