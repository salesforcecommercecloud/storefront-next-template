/**
 * Baseline type-level tests for the SDK's `useConfig()` narrow.
 *
 * These run against the unaugmented SDK shape (no template `declare module`).
 * `ClientFacingAppConfig` is a conditional type:
 *   - When `ClientFacingAppConfigShape` is empty (today's bare-SDK state), it
 *     resolves to `AppConfigShape` — bare-SDK callers retain today's wide-read
 *     behavior. Zero-breakage upgrade.
 *   - When a template fills `ClientFacingAppConfigShape` (typically with
 *     `Omit<AppConfig, 'serverExtension'>`), it resolves to that augmented shape
 *     — the narrow.
 *
 * The augmented case is covered by `template-retail-rsc-app/src/types/config-narrow.test.ts`,
 * which is where the `@ts-expect-error` proof of the actual narrow lives.
 *
 * Module-augmentation is intentionally NOT used here — augmentations are
 * program-wide and would leak into every other test in this package.
 *
 * Run under `pnpm typecheck`, not `pnpm test`. The `expectTypeOf` call is a
 * compile-time check — vitest's runtime pass executes the test body but doesn't
 * enforce type assertions, so a regression surfaces in tsc, not in the test
 * runner. CI gates on the typecheck step.
