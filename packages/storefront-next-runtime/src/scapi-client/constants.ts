/**
 * Path patterns for SLAS authentication endpoints.
 * These endpoints handle their own authentication (Basic auth, PKCE, etc.)
 * and should NOT have Bearer tokens auto-injected by middleware.
 *
 * Use with URL.pathname.includes() to check if a request targets a SLAS auth endpoint.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const isSlasAuthEndpoint = SLAS_AUTH_ENDPOINTS.some(path => url.pathname.includes(path));
 * if (isSlasAuthEndpoint) {
 *     // Skip Bearer token injection - endpoint handles its own auth
 *     return request;
 * }
 * ```
