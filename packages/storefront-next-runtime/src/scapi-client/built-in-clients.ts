/**
 * Single source of truth for built-in SCAPI client configuration.
 *
 * Both `createCommerceApiClients` (runtime) and `sfnext scapi add` (dev CLI) read from
 * this map so an override registered via the CLI inherits the same per-client semantics
 * the SDK uses internally — locale-awareness, base-path — and the two stay in sync by
 * construction rather than by hand-mirroring.
 *
 * Each built-in SCAPI schema includes `/organizations/{organizationId}` in its path
 * patterns (and thus in the generated ops map's BASE_PATH), so the URL-prefix here is
 * the part *before* the org segment. Both the runtime and the CLI build the final URL
 * the same way: `${apiBaseUrl}${client.basePath}` with `/organizations/{organizationId}`
 * supplied via the ops map at request time.
