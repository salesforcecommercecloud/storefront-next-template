 * 3. If `process.env.VERTICAL` is set, scan `src/verticals/${VERTICAL}/routes/` and

 * 4. Load `config.server.ts` from the project root and, if `app.url` is configured,
 *    wrap routes under the URL prefix (e.g. `/:siteId/:localeId`).
 *

 * @param options.rootDirectory - Root directory for route discovery, relative to appDirectory.
