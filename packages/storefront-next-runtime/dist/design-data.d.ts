/**
 * Main entry point for the page resolution pipeline. Orchestrates the full flow:
 *
 * 1. **Resolve dynamic page ID** — For product/category identifiers, looks up
 *    the assigned page ID via content assignments in the site manifest.
 * 2. **Fetch page manifest** — Loads all variations for the resolved page.
 * 3. **Select variation** — Evaluates visibility rules to pick the right variation.
 * 4. **Load qualifier context** — Lazily fetches the shopper's context only if needed.
 * 5. **Process page** — Filters out components that fail visibility rules.
 *
 * Returns `null` if the page ID cannot be resolved, the manifest doesn't exist,
 * or no variation is available.
 *
 * @param options - The resolution options.
 * @param options.id - The identifier to resolve (product ID, category ID, or page ID).
 * @param options.identifierType - The type of identifier: `'product'`, `'category'`, or `'page'`.
 * @param options.locale - The locale to resolve the page for (e.g. `"en-US"`).
 * @param options.manifestStorage - Storage implementation for fetching manifests.
 * @param options.contextResolver - Optional async function that returns the shopper's qualifier context. Only called if a visibility rule needs it.
 * @param options.aspectType - The aspect type to resolve the page for when the identifier type is `'product'` or `'category'`.
 * @param options.categoryId - Optional fallback category ID (or a Promise resolving to one) used only when `identifierType` is `'product'` and the product has no content assignment for the requested aspect type. The promise is awaited lazily — the happy path never pays for it.
 * @param options.pruneInvisible - When `true` (default), invisible and overflow components are removed. When `false`, they are kept but marked `visible: false` for design/preview mode.
 * @returns The fully resolved and filtered page, or `null`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { resolvePage } from '@salesforce/storefront-next-runtime/design/data';
 *
 * // Resolve the PDP page for a specific product with an active holiday campaign

/**
 * Evaluates a visibility rule against a shopper's qualifier context.
 *
 * Campaign-based and non-campaign rules are **mutually exclusive** paths,
 * matching the server's `VisibilityDefinition.isVisible()` logic:
 *
 * - **Campaign-based rule** (has `campaignQualifiers`): only the campaign
 *   qualifiers are checked. Schedule, locale, and customer-group fields are
 *   ignored because the campaign qualification already incorporates those
 *   checks server-side.
 * - **Non-campaign rule**: locale, schedule, AND customer groups are checked.
 *   All specified conditions must pass.
 *
 * When no context is provided and the rule requires campaign or customer group
 * checks, those checks will fail (returning `false`). Schedule checks do not
 * require context and are evaluated against `Date.now()`.
 *
 * @param rule - The visibility rule to evaluate.
 * @param locale - The current locale (e.g. `"en_US"`). Used to check whether the rule applies to this locale.
 * @param context - The shopper's active qualifiers, or `null`/`undefined` if not yet resolved.
 * @returns `true` if the rule's conditions pass, `false` otherwise.
